# flashcard
This is a flashcard project/app
It picks out words randomly from a data(in this case a french data), which it displays for three seconds afterwhich the english equivalent of the word is displayed
If the user knows the translation of the current word being displayed, the user clicks on the green(checkmark) button,
and that word is removed from the list of words(french data) that can be displayed so that only words the user does not knw gets displayed.
